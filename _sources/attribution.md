# Attributions 

Many excellent people have contributed to this material. The original content was put together by [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/) as powerpoint slides. Since then Varada Kolhatkar has contributed and developed the material further. Some of the material is borrowed from CPSC 330, which was first developed by Mike Gelbart and then modified and updated by Varada Kolhatkar.
