    "One more application of clustering is _vector quantization_, where we find a prototype point for each cluster and replace points in the cluster by their prototype. If our inputs are images, vector quantization gives us a rudimentary image compression algorithm.\n",

    "We will implement image quantization by filling in the `quantize` and `dequantize` functions below. The `quantize` function should take in an image,  and using the pixels as examples and the 3 colour channels as features, run K-Means clustering on the data with $2^b$ clusters for some hyperparameter $b$. The code should store the cluster means and return the cluster assignments. The `dequantize` function should return a version of the image (the same size as the original) where each pixel's original colour is replaced with the nearest prototype colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why this is compression, consider the original image space. Say the image can take on the values $0,1,\\ldots,255$ in each colour channel. Since $2^8=256$ this means we need 8 bits to represent each colour channel, for a total of 24 bits per pixel. Using our method, we are restricting each pixel to only take on one of $2^b$ colour values. In other words, we are compressing each pixel from a 24-bit colour representation to a $b$-bit colour representation by picking the $2^b$ prototype colours that are \"most representative\" given the content of the image. \n",

    "\n",
    "> *Note 1: If you actually try saving this as a file, you won't see the file size being what you expected, because Python won't know to allocate exactly $b$ bits per element of `quantized_img`, and will instead probably store them as 32-bit integers if you don't specify otherwise. But if one wanted to work harder, it would be theoretically possible to store the elements with $b$ bits per pixel. Also, all this is before any additional lossless compression.*\n",
